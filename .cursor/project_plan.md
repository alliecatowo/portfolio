# Dual Portfolio Website Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive dual portfolio website for a professional who is both a tattoo artist and a developer. The website will consist of two main sections:

1. **Developer Portfolio** (allisons.dev)
   - Showcasing technical skills, projects, and open-source tools
   - Professional but creative design with a focus on expertise

2. **Tattoo Artist Portfolio** (allisons.gay)
   - Gallery of tattoo work, style information, and artist journey
   - Artistic, visually striking design to showcase creative abilities

Both portfolios will share a common codebase and infrastructure but will have distinct visual identities and content focus.

## Technical Architecture
