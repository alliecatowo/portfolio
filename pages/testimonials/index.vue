          Don't just take my word for it â€“ here's what clients have to say about their experiences 
          and the tattoos we've created together. Each tattoo tells a story, and I'm grateful to be 
          part of these personal journeys.

    question: "What's your approach to custom designs?",

    question: "Do you offer touch-ups?",

    question: "What should I do to prepare for my tattoo session?",
