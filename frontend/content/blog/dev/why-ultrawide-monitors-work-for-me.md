# Why Ultrawide Monitors Work for Me

It’s not about pixels—it’s about posture and attention. Ultrawides let me lay out code, docs, and a live app without window Tetris. My shoulders thank me; my brain stays in the work.

## Small habits that make it sing

- Fixed columns for editor, preview, and logs
- Minimal desktop widgets
- Gentle color themes to reduce eye fatigue

I do more with fewer mental tab switches. That’s the win.
