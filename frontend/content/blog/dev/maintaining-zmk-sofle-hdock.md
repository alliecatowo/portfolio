# Maintaining a ZMK Sofle Fork (hdock/dongle)

Manufacturers ship what they can. Communities ship what they need. My ZMK Sofle fork adds hdock/dongle support, clear English docs, and configuration defaults that work for real people on real desks.

## Principles

- Documentation is a feature. If someone can’t flash and pair in under ten minutes, we failed.
- Defaults should be generous. Good power management, sane keymaps, easy remapping—no heroics required.
- Accessibility is adoption. Translations and screenshots matter more than we admit.

The goal isn’t to “own” a firmware—it’s to help more people discover that comfort and control are worth the switch.

## What’s in the fork

- Clean English docs with screenshots
- Pairing guide for hdock/dongle (and recovery)
- Starter keymaps that prioritize editing/navigation
- Notes on battery life and sleep behavior
