# Falling for Split Keyboards: Sofle ZMK, Lily58, and HolyKeebs Peripherals

Split keyboards changed how I work. My hands relax. My shoulders drop. And with ZMK on a Sofle and a QMK Lily58 nearby, I can mold input to the way my brain actually thinks.

The pink Sofle above runs my ZMK fork and has been my daily driver for over a year. Those OLED screens show layer status, WPM, and custom graphics that make me smile every time I glance down.

## Why splits stuck

- Comfort first: Columnar stagger and proper tenting removed the tension I didn’t realize I’d normalized.
- Layers as language: Once you accept layers, your keyboard becomes an instrument. Text editing, nav, symbols, macros—everything falls into place.
- Peripherals matter: A HolyKeebs touchpad, trackball, or trackpoint keeps my mouse hand from wandering. The whole rig works with me, not against me.

## About the Sofle ZMK fork

I maintain a fork of the Sofle ZMK firmware (especially for hdock/dongle pairings). It's translated, documented, and maintained so others can get up and running without falling into a weekend of yak‑shaving. Community work should feel welcoming.

The Lily58 above features an integrated trackpad module - perfect for those moments when you need precise cursor control but don't want to reach for a mouse. It sits beautifully on my space-themed desk mat alongside other keyboards in my collection.

I believe a lot more people would love splits if the first‑run experience were better. That's what my fork tries to provide.

## Tools that help

- ZMK + nice!nano/nrf52 boards
- QMK for Lily58 experiments
- VIA/Vial when I’m in the QMK world
- Portability: hdock/dongle pairs that “just connect”

## Who should try splits?

Anyone who types a lot and feels the tension at the end of a day. With good defaults, the learning curve is a week—not months.

## My layers, in practice

- Base: home‑row mods (caps as Ctrl/Esc via tap‑dance), symbols on a near layer
- Nav/Edit: HJKL arrows, word/line jumps, select/expand, common IDE chords
- Numbers: numpad cluster on the right with calc shortcuts
- Media/Mouse: volume, brightness, and a small cursor layer for laptop sessions

I change one thing at a time and live with it for a week. The map stabilizes because I'm practicing, not tinkering endlessly.

The RGB lighting isn't just for show—different colors help me identify layers at a glance. When I'm in my navigation layer, the keys glow blue. Symbols get a warm orange. It's functional eye candy that makes the whole experience more enjoyable.
