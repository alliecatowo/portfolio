# Meshtastic: Why Hyperlocal Communication Matters

I love the way Meshtastic shrinks the world: a few inexpensive nodes, a little power, and suddenly you have ambient community without cell towers or cloud accounts.

It’s not just a backup system. It’s a different social shape—slow, local, and resilient. That resonates with the way I think about tech: empower the edges and remove unnecessary intermediaries.

## What I’m experimenting with

- Neighborhood bulletin channels with etiquette baked in
- Low‑power solar nodes
- Useful payloads: weather, alerts, meetups
