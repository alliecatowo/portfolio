# Keyboard Tools I Actually Use

People ask how I manage layers and firmware without losing days to tinkering. Here’s the short list.

## Firmware and flashing

- ZMK + West for Sofle/NRF52 boards
- QMK Toolbox when I’m in the QMK world

## Layout and tuning

- VIA/Vial for quick experiments on QMK boards
- Keymap layers tuned for editing, nav, and symbols first; everything else second

## Daily sanity

- A printed keymap nearby for new layers
- One‑week “practice window” for any big change before deciding

This is how I keep tinkering fun—and keep shipping.
