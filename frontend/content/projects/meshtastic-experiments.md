Small meshes, big smiles. I prototype local messaging that works when the internet doesn’t—and builds community when it does.

Highlights

- Low‑power nodes with sensible ranges
- Neighborhood‑friendly etiquette and channels
- Weather, alerts, and casual check‑ins

Resilience can be friendly.

Notes

- Power constraints shape etiquette
- Discovery is a feature—make it welcoming
- Document the boring parts; they’re the brittle ones
