This tool pulls highlights from your inbox and favorite feeds, clusters them by theme, and generates a short daily audio briefing you can listen to on the way to work.

Highlights

- Topic clustering to avoid repetition
- Natural TTS voices with clean handoff to players

It turns information overload into a calm ritual.

Roadmap
