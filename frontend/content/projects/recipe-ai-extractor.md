This project ingests short‑form videos, transcribes speech, and synthesizes clean recipe cards with ingredients, quantities, and step timing. It can render a printable PDF for the kitchen.

Highlights

- Robust ingestion from social platforms
- Speaker‑aware transcription and cleanup
- Structured recipe model with units normalization
- Optional PDF rendering via Gotenberg

Built for real‑world messiness, not idealized demos.

Roadmap

- OCR fallback for on‑screen ingredients
- Unit conversion and “pantry mode” scaling
- Family share links with print presets
