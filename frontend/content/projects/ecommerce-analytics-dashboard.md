## Challenges Faced & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Data Processing at Scale
**Problem**: Processing 10,000+ transactions per hour while maintaining real-time dashboard updates.

**Solution**: Implemented a hybrid architecture:
```javascript
// Event-driven processing with batching optimization
class TransactionProcessor {
  private batchQueue: Transaction[] = [];
  private readonly BATCH_SIZE = 100;
  private readonly BATCH_TIMEOUT = 1000; // 1 second

  async processTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
    this.batchQueue.push(transaction);
    
    if (this.batchQueue.length >= this.BATCH_SIZE) {
      await this.processBatch();
    }
  }

  private async processBatch() {
    const batch = this.batchQueue.splice(0, this.BATCH_SIZE);
    await this.bulkUpdateDatabase(batch);
    await this.broadcastUpdates(batch);
  }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Complex Data Relationships
**Problem**: Connecting customer data across multiple touchpoints and time periods.

**Solution**: Designed a flexible schema with composite indexes:
```sql
-- Optimized query structure for cross-platform analytics
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_customer_journey 
ON transactions (customer_id, timestamp, platform, session_id);

-- Materialized view for complex aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_lifetime_metrics AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  SUM(total_amount) as lifetime_value,
  AVG(total_amount) as average_order_value
FROM transactions 
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### Challenge 3: Dashboard Performance with Large Datasets
**Problem**: Rendering charts with 100,000+ data points caused browser freezing.

**Solution**: Implemented data virtualization and intelligent aggregation:
```typescript
// Smart data aggregation based on time range
const getOptimizedMetrics = (dateRange: DateRange) => {
  const daysDiff = differenceInDays(dateRange.end, dateRange.start);
  
  if (daysDiff > 365) {
    return getMonthlyAggregates(dateRange);
  } else if (daysDiff > 30) {
    return getDailyAggregates(dateRange);
  } else {
    return getHourlyAggregates(dateRange);
  }
};
```

## Code Snippets - Key Implementations

### Real-time WebSocket Implementation
```typescript
// WebSocket connection manager for live updates
class DashboardWebSocket {
  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;
  private reconnectAttempts = 0;
  private readonly MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS = 5;

  connect(userId: string) {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(`${WEBSOCKET_URL}?userId=${userId}`);
    
    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      this.handleRealTimeUpdate(data);
    };

    this.ws.onclose = () => {
      this.handleReconnection();
    };
  }

  private handleRealTimeUpdate(data: RealTimeUpdate) {
    switch (data.type) {
      case 'TRANSACTION':
        updateTransactionMetrics(data.payload);
        break;
      case 'INVENTORY_ALERT':
        showInventoryNotification(data.payload);
        break;
      case 'CUSTOMER_EVENT':
        updateCustomerJourney(data.payload);
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Analytics Query Engine
```typescript
// Flexible query builder for complex analytics
class AnalyticsQueryBuilder {
  private query: QueryConfig = {};

  timeRange(start: Date, end: Date) {
    this.query.timeRange = { start, end };
    return this;
  }

  groupBy(dimension: string) {
    this.query.groupBy = dimension;
    return this;
  }

  metrics(metrics: string[]) {
    this.query.metrics = metrics;
    return this;
  }

  async execute(): Promise<AnalyticsResult> {
    const sql = this.buildSQL();
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey();
    
    let result = await redis.get(cacheKey);
    if (!result) {
      result = await database.query(sql, this.query.parameters);
      await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(result));
    }
    
    return this.formatResult(result);
  }
}
```
