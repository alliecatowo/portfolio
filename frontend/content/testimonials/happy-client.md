# Client Testimonial - Sarah Martinez

**Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)**

## The Experience

"I was nervous about getting my first large tattoo, but Allie made the entire process so comfortable and professional. From our initial consultation where we discussed my vision for a delicate floral forearm piece, to the final touch-ups, every step was handled with care and expertise.

## The Artwork

The attention to detail in my floral piece is incredible - every petal, leaf, and stem was carefully crafted with precision. Allie really listened to what I wanted and brought my vision to life in ways I hadn't even imagined. The shading and line work are absolutely beautiful, and I get compliments on it constantly.

## Professionalism

What impressed me most was:
- **Cleanliness**: The studio was spotless and all safety protocols were followed
- **Communication**: Allie explained each step and checked in regularly during sessions
- **Aftercare**: Detailed instructions and follow-up to ensure proper healing
- **Respect**: My comfort and boundaries were always respected

## Healing Process

The aftercare instructions were clear and easy to follow. My tattoo healed perfectly with vibrant colors and crisp lines. Allie even checked in a few weeks later to see how everything was healing.

## Final Thoughts

I couldn't be happier with my tattoo and the entire experience. Allie is not just an incredibly talented artist, but also a professional who truly cares about their clients. I'm already planning my next piece!

**Would I recommend Allie?** Absolutely, without hesitation. 10/10 experience."
