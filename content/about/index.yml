introduction:
  - >-
    I'm a software engineer and tattoo artist living with my fiancé Violet and our two rescued
    chinchillas in a setup that perfectly blends code, creativity, and chaos. By day, I build web
    applications with Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, and modern tooling. By evening, I translate ideas into
    permanent art on skin.
  - >-
    My journey into tech started with teenage curiosity—customizing MySpace profiles and building
    terrible websites that somehow worked. What began as digital tinkering evolved into a career
    spanning startups, established companies, and everything in between. I've shipped applications for
    healthcare, e-commerce, education, and finance, always focusing on user experience and maintainable
    code.
  - >-
    Tattooing entered my life as a creative outlet that software couldn't provide. There's something
    profound about creating permanent art that becomes part of someone's story. The precision required,
    the collaboration with clients, the immediate tactile feedback—it complements coding in ways I never
    expected. Both crafts require patience, attention to detail, and the ability to bring someone's vision
    to life.
  - >-
    At home, our rescued chinchillas Ray and Paddy keep life interesting. Ray is our gentle giant who
    perfected the art of being a furry loaf, while Paddy brings endless energy and mischief. They're active
    during my late-night coding sessions, which works out perfectly. I also maintain a collection of split
    keyboards—my daily driver is a pink Sofle running my ZMK fork with OLED screens, and a Lily58 with an
    integrated trackpad for when precision cursor control matters.

        It started with MySpace profile customization and terrible HTML experiments. I was that kid who
        viewed source on every website, trying to understand how digital things worked. Building my first
        "Hello World" page felt like magic—I could create something from nothing but text in a file.

      description: >-
        College gave me the theory—algorithms, data structures, software engineering principles. But the
        real learning happened during internships and first jobs, where I discovered that shipping working
        software requires much more than perfect code. Communication, collaboration, and understanding user
        needs became as important as technical skills.

      description: >-
        Years of startup life, scaling challenges, and diverse projects across healthcare, fintech, and
        e-commerce taught me that technology is only as good as the problems it solves. Around this time, I
        discovered tattooing—initially as stress relief, but it quickly became a parallel creative practice
        that informed my approach to software development.

    - title: 'Present Day'
      description: >-
        Now I balance software engineering with tattoo artistry, finding that each practice strengthens the
        other. I maintain open-source keyboard firmware, write about technology and creativity, and continue
        building applications that solve real problems. Violet and our chinchillas keep me grounded,
        reminding me that the best work happens when you bring your whole self to it.
