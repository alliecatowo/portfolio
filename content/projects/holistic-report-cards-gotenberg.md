Education needs reporting that reflects humans, not just numbers. This hybrid web app generates holistic reports—narratives, goals, and growth indicators—at district scale.

Highlights

- Batch generation with robust queuing and retries
- Gotenberg‑based PDF rendering for consistency
- Accessible, print‑friendly layouts that survive photocopiers
- Admin workflows for revisions and approvals

It’s built to handle hundreds of thousands of documents without breaking a sweat.

Roadmap

- Parent/guardian portals with secure links
- Multilingual templates and RTL support
- Analytics on common goals and growth areas (privacy‑respecting)
