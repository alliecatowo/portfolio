This is the infrastructure behind my media life: consistent, quiet, and easy to maintain. It emphasizes sensible defaults and observability over over‑engineering.

Highlights

- Reverse‑proxy simplicity with Caddy
- Health checks and dashboards via Portainer
- Privacy‑respecting networking with VPN routing

I like systems that look boring from the outside and feel delightful from the inside.

Notes

- Backups: off‑site snapshots on a schedule
- Monitoring: simple dashboards, not an observability thesis
- Power: graceful shutdowns and UPS alerts
