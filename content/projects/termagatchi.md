description: A Digital AI Pet That Lives in your Terminal!

### Overview

Termagatchi started as a joke between productivity and nostalgia: “what if you could have a Tamagotchi in your terminal?” It evolved into a fully interactive command-line companion powered by modern language models.

You feed it, play with it, and chat like it’s your weird little coworker; except under the hood, it’s running an **AI-driven game engine**, persistent state management, and a **real-time Textual UI** that turns your terminal into a digital habitat.

### Problem

Most AI projects chase complexity with web dashboards, APIs, flashy front-ends. I wanted to do the opposite: build something *delightful* and *deeply technical* that lives where developers actually are: the command line.

The goal was to combine:

- nostalgic interaction (virtual pets),
- a modern terminal UI,
- and advanced conversational AI — all without leaving the shell.

### Solution

I built Termagatchi using **Python 3.11+**, **Textual**, and **UV**, blending game logic, LLM interaction, and terminal UX into one package.

**Core systems:**

- 🤖 **AI Personality Engine** – Integrates Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local Ollama models.
- 🎮 **Game Loop** – Manages hunger, happiness, energy, hygiene, affection, and health in real time.
- 📊 **Persistent Saves** – Your pet remembers everything between sessions.
- 🎨 **Textual UI** – Responsive, animated, and color-themed interface.
- ⚙️ **Extensible Framework** – Modular provider system for AI backends and mechanics.

The whole thing runs locally. No backend, no cloud dependency; just pure Python and a healthy dose of serotonin.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was balancing *game feel* with *AI performance*. LLMs are slow compared to a traditional game loop, so I built a hybrid tick system that keeps gameplay responsive while AI tasks run asynchronously. Designing believable personality states, ones that persist and evolve naturally, was another rabbit hole entirely.

### Impact

- Brought **AI interaction into the command line** in a way that’s actually fun.
- Demonstrated real-time stateful gameplay over LLM backends.
- Used by developers and hobbyists as both a demo app and stress relief tool.
- Laid the groundwork for future “AI pet” experiments and interactive CLIs.

### Reflection

Termagatchi is a love letter to the terminal; proof that creativity and code can coexist in a text window. It’s whimsical, a little absurd, and deeply technical under the hood. It taught me a lot about threading, UI design, and how to make AI *feel alive* instead of just “smart.”

### Tech Stack

**Python 3.11+**, **Textual**, **UV**, **TOML**, **LLM APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)**
