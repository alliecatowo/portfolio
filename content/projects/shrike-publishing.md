# Shrike Publishing

*A lightweight, modern web platform for a small tabletop game studio.*

### Overview

Shrike Publishing needed a professional, low-maintenance home for their tabletop RPG catalog. Something that looked great, loaded fast, and didn’t bury them in hosting or CMS fees.

So I designed and built a clean static site using **Nuxt 4**, **Vue 3**, and **TailwindCSS**, integrated with Nuxt Content for an editor-friendly publishing flow. The result: a website that anyone on their team can update using Markdown, deployed as a zero-cost static site.

### Problem

The original website was built on a paid WordPress plan that limited embeds, plugins, and admin control. It was overkill for a small creative studio; they needed something leaner, easier to maintain, and **free** to host.

The main goals were:

- Remove dependency on closed hosting or recurring subscriptions.
- Allow non-technical contributors to update pages easily.
- Preserve fast performance and good SEO for product visibility.

### Solution

Shrike Publishing was rebuilt from the ground up with **Nuxt Content Studio** as the headless CMS.

- **Markdown-driven content** for games, news, and product updates.
- **TailwindCSS** for rapid design iteration and consistent theming.
- **TypeScript** for type safety and scalable component patterns.
- **Zero-cost deployment** via GitHub Pages and static generation.

I built the entire platform as a static Nuxt site. That means no backend, no database, no monthly bill; all while keeping the same editorial flexibility as a CMS.

### Impact

- Reduced hosting costs from **$45/month → $0**.
- Enabled non-technical staff to manage and publish updates directly via Markdown.
- Improved SEO and loading speeds across all devices.
- Simplified long-term maintenance — no databases, plugins, or updates to babysit.

### Reflection

Shrike was a reminder that simple tech, done well, can be transformative. It doesn’t take a complicated stack to deliver real value — just clean design, predictable tooling, and empathy for the people who’ll maintain it later.
