## Core Features Implementation

### Product Catalog System

```typescript
// Product service with caching
class ProductService {
  async getProducts(filters: ProductFilters): Promise<Product[]> {
    const cacheKey = `products:${JSON.stringify(filters)}`

    // Check Redis cache
    const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey)
    if (cached) {
      return JSON.parse(cached)
    }

    // Query database with Prisma
    const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
      where: {
        active: true,
        ...this.buildWhereClause(filters),
      },
      include: {
        variants: true,
        images: true,
        category: true,
      },
    })

    // Cache results for 5 minutes
    await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(products))

    return products
  }
}
```

### Shopping Cart Management

```typescript
// React hook for cart management
export const useCart = () => {
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
  const { items, total, loading } = useAppSelector(state => state.cart)

  const addItem = useCallback(
    async (productId: string, quantity: number) => {
      dispatch(cartActions.setLoading(true))

      try {
        const response = await api.post('/cart/items', {
          productId,
          quantity,
        })

        dispatch(cartActions.addItem(response.data))
        toast.success('Item added to cart')
      } catch (error) {
        toast.error('Failed to add item')
      } finally {
        dispatch(cartActions.setLoading(false))
      }
    },
    [dispatch]
  )

  return { items, total, loading, addItem }
}
```

### Payment Processing

```typescript
// Stripe integration for secure payments
class PaymentService {
  async createPaymentIntent(orderId: string): Promise<PaymentIntent> {
    const order = await orderService.getById(orderId)

    if (!order) {
      throw new Error('Order not found')
    }

    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: Math.round(order.total * 100), // Convert to cents
      currency: 'usd',
      metadata: {
        orderId: order.id,
        customerId: order.customerId,
      },
    })

    return paymentIntent
  }

  async confirmPayment(paymentIntentId: string): Promise<void> {
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.retrieve(paymentIntentId)

    if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
      await orderService.markAsPaid(paymentIntent.metadata.orderId)
      await emailService.sendOrderConfirmation(paymentIntent.metadata.orderId)
    }
  }
}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Inventory Management

**Problem**: Preventing overselling when multiple customers purchase the same item simultaneously
**Solution**:

- Database-level constraints on stock quantities
- Redis-based inventory locks during checkout
- Background job for inventory reconciliation
- Real-time stock updates via WebSockets

```typescript
// Inventory lock mechanism
class InventoryService {
  async reserveStock(productId: string, quantity: number): Promise<string> {
    const lockKey = `inventory:${productId}`
    const lockId = uuidv4()

    // Acquire distributed lock
    const acquired = await redis.set(lockKey, lockId, 'PX', 30000, 'NX')

    if (!acquired) {
      throw new Error('Unable to acquire inventory lock')
    }

    try {
      // Check available stock
      const available = await this.getAvailableStock(productId)

      if (available < quantity) {
        throw new Error('Insufficient stock')
      }

      // Reserve stock
      await prisma.stockReservation.create({
        data: {
          productId,
          quantity,
          expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000), // 15 minutes
        },
      })

      return lockId
    } finally {
      // Release lock
      await redis.del(lockKey)
    }
  }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Performance Under High Load

**Problem**: Slow response times during peak traffic periods
**Solution**:

- Implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Database query optimization and proper indexing
- CDN integration for static assets
- API rate limiting and request queuing

### Challenge 3: Payment Security

**Problem**: Ensuring PCI compliance and secure payment handling
**Solution**:

- Used Stripe's secure tokenization system
- Implemented server-side payment validation
- Added fraud detection hooks
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Challenge 4: Complex Order Workflows

**Problem**: Managing multi-step order fulfillment process
**Solution**:

- Implemented state machine pattern for order status
- Created automated workflow engine
- Built notification system for status updates
- Added manual override capabilities for administrators

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations

- Code splitting with React.lazy()
- Image lazy loading and WebP format
- Bundle analysis and tree shaking
- Service worker for offline functionality

### Backend Optimizations

- Database connection pooling
- Query result caching with Redis
- API response compression
- Background job processing

### Infrastructure Optimizations

- Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- Load balancing across multiple app instances
- Database read replicas for query distribution

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

```typescript
// JWT-based authentication middleware
export const authenticateToken = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization
  const token = authHeader?.split(' ')[1]

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Access token required' })
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET!, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid or expired token' })
    }

    req.user = decoded as JWTPayload
    next()
  })
}

// Role-based authorization
export const requireRole = (roles: string[]) => {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' })
    }
    next()
  }
}
```

### Data Protection

- Input sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content security policy
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

```typescript
// Product service unit tests
describe('ProductService', () => {
  let productService: ProductService

  beforeEach(() => {
    productService = new ProductService()
  })

  describe('getProducts', () => {
    it('should return cached products when available', async () => {
      const mockProducts = [{ id: '1', name: 'Test Product' }]
      jest.spyOn(redis, 'get').mockResolvedValue(JSON.stringify(mockProducts))

      const result = await productService.getProducts({})

      expect(result).toEqual(mockProducts)
      expect(prisma.product.findMany).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
    })
  })
})
```

### Integration Testing
