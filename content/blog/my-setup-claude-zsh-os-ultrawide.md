# My Everyday Setup: Claude Code, zsh, OS Choices, and Ultrawides

I like tools that disappear. The best gear makes the work feel inevitable.

## AI as accelerator

I use Claude Code as a thinking partner and a friction reducer. It helps me synthesize ideas quickly and pull code from my head into the editor without losing flow. It doesn’t replace judgment—it amplifies it.

## Shell and ergonomics

zsh with a minimal prompt, fast history search, and a handful of aliases. I prefer clean, predictable shells over kitchen‑sink frameworks. Keyboard layers do the rest.

## Operating systems

- Mac at work: It just runs, and I’ve grown to love it.
- Kubuntu at home: Plasma is pleasant without being loud. I’m not a huge Ubuntu fan and I get the snap complaints, but Kubuntu has been a refreshing reset while I tour other options.

## Screens and focus

Ultrawides are my sweet spot. One canvas, many contexts, no window Tetris. It’s easier on my attention and kinder to my neck.

The theme across all of this: fewer obstacles, more flow.

## A few tiny things that matter

- Caps as Ctrl/Escape with tap‑dance
- Key repeat tuned for editing
- Minimal notifications; ambient music
- Night light and softer contrasts in the evening
