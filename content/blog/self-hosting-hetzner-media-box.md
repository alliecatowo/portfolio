# My Self‑Hosted Stack on a 16TB Hetzner Box

I like owning my media and my infrastructure. A bare‑metal Hetzner machine with 16TB gives me the flexibility and headroom I need—at a price that still feels unreal.

## What’s running

- Plex and Jellyfin for viewing
- Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, LazyLibrarian for automation
- qBittorrent with sensible limits
- ProtonVPN for privacy
- Portainer for management
- Caddy as a simple, smart edge
- Jellyseerr for family requests

It’s quiet, resilient, and fun to tinker with. The point isn’t to recreate Big Tech at home—it’s to build just enough that your tools feel like yours.

## Values behind the stack

- Ownership over convenience (selectively)
- Privacy first, family‑friendly second
- Documented setup so future‑me thanks past‑me
