# Kando: Tools That Spark Joy in the Work

Kando is the satisfying jolt when a tool feels right. A good pen on smooth paper. A rotary machine that hums instead of fights. A framework that vanishes so the idea can breathe.

## What kando feels like in software

- Fewer sharp edges and gotchas
- Clear names and defaults that fit the real world
- Docs that answer the question you actually had

## Why it matters

Kando isn’t fluff. It keeps you in flow longer. It helps you ship more often. It’s a signal that the designers respected your time—and your attention.
