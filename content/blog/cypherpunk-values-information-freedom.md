# Cypherpunk Values: Information Freedom and Care

Security isn’t a vibe. It’s math, discipline, and respect. I care about cryptography not because it’s cool, but because it protects people—especially the ones without power.

## What I believe

- Privacy is a prerequisite for dignity.
- Security should be the default in consumer tools, not an opt‑in advanced mode.
- Open standards win in the long run because they allow collective defense.

We can build systems that are both humane and hardened. That’s the bar I try to hold, even on small projects.

## Practice over posture

- End‑to‑end encryption by default when it makes sense
- Clear data lifetimes and deletion that actually deletes
- Small, interoperable systems over monoliths we can’t reason about

## Threat modeling for “small” projects

Even tiny tools deserve a quick pass: what data do we hold, who could harm whom if it leaked, and how do we minimize blast radius? A few minutes up front prevents a lot of regret later.
