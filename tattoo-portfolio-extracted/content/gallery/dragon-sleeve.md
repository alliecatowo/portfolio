# Japanese Dragon Sleeve

This stunning Japanese dragon sleeve represents one of my most detailed and rewarding projects to date. The design incorporates traditional Japanese elements with a modern approach to shading and composition.

## Design Elements

The centerpiece features a powerful dragon with:

- Detailed scale work throughout the body
- Dynamic pose showing movement and energy
- Traditional Japanese dragon characteristics
- Intricate facial features and flowing whiskers

### üå∏ Cherry Blossoms

Delicate sakura flowers provide:

- Soft contrast to the bold dragon
- Seasonal symbolism
- Feminine balance to the masculine dragon
- Color accents in soft pinks

### üíß Water Elements

Traditional wave patterns include:

- Flowing movement throughout the composition
- Negative space utilization
- Connection between all design elements
- Classic Japanese wave styling

## Technical Approach

- **Session 2**: Dragon body shading and scales (4 hours)
- **Session 3**: Water elements and background (4 hours)
- **Session 4**: Cherry blossoms and final details (4 hours)

### Artistic Techniques

## Client Experience

## Symbolism

In Japanese culture, dragons represent:

The cherry blossoms add themes of:
