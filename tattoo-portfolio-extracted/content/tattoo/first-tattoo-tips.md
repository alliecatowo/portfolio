# Essential Tips for Your First Tattoo Experience

Getting your first tattoo is an exciting milestone! Here's everything you need to know to make the experience smooth and ensure you end up with a tattoo you'll love forever.

## Before You Get Tattooed

### Research Your Artist

- Look at their portfolio extensively
- Check reviews and recommendations
- Ensure they follow proper hygiene standards
- Visit the shop in person

### Design Considerations

- Take time to think about your design
- Consider placement carefully
- Start smaller for your first tattoo
- Bring reference images

### Preparation Tips

- Get a good night's sleep
- Eat a proper meal beforehand
- Stay hydrated
- Avoid alcohol 24 hours before

## During Your Session

### What to Expect

- Some discomfort is normal
- Sessions can take 1-6+ hours depending on size
- Communicate with your artist
- Take breaks when needed

### Pain Management

- Different areas have different pain levels
- Breathe deeply and stay relaxed
- Bring headphones for distraction
- Don't be afraid to ask for a break

## Aftercare is Crucial

### First 24 Hours

- Keep the bandage on as instructed
- Gently wash with unscented soap
- Pat dry, don't rub
- Apply thin layer of recommended ointment

### Following Weeks

- Keep it moisturized but not over-saturated
- Avoid soaking (no baths, swimming)
- Don't pick at scabs
- Protect from direct sunlight

## Common Myths (and what actually helps)

- “More ointment heals faster” — Too much suffocates your skin. Thin layers only.
- “It’s fine to hit the gym tomorrow” — Sweat and friction can irritate a fresh tattoo. Give it a couple days.
- “A quick sun session won’t hurt” — UV is the enemy of tattoos, especially fresh ones. Cover it.

## What to Bring to Your Session

- Snacks and water for longer sits
- Headphones and a playlist/podcast
- A loose layer to keep the area clean on the way home

## Pricing and Time

Good work costs what it costs—and that’s a reflection of planning, hygiene, and experience. Ask questions, get a quote range, and remember that we can break big ideas into multiple sessions.

## Booking with Me

I book consults to align on design, placement, and timeline. Bring references (even rough ones), tell me the feeling you’re going for, and we’ll translate that into a piece that ages beautifully.

## Final Thoughts

Your first tattoo should be a positive experience. Take your time choosing the right artist and design, and don't rush the process. Remember, a good tattoo isn't cheap, and a cheap tattoo isn't good!

Book a consultation to discuss your ideas and get started on your tattoo journey.
