# Tattooing and Programming: Two Crafts, One Mindset

Tattooing and programming look different from the outside. One smells like green soap, the other like coffee and warm laptops. But inside both is the same craft: precision, empathy, and honoring the person you’re building for.

## Tools and choices

Tattooists pick machines the way devs pick frameworks. A rotary wand feels like Nuxt: smooth, predictable, optimized for flow. A coil machine is like raw React or even C++—incredibly flexible, punchy, and unforgiving. Neither is “better.” What matters is control, result, and your relationship with the tool.

## Translating vision into technique

Clients bring ideas. The craft is translating those ideas into techniques that will age well on real skin—line weight, placement, saturation, longevity. Software’s the same: translate requirements into systems that are fast, accessible, and maintainable. Both disciplines reward taste and restraint.

## Why it matters to me

Tattooing connects me to the thousands of years of humans making marks that mean something. Programming is newer—but it still scratches that itch for precision, mastery, and making someone’s life easier. Both soothe me. Both feel like armor and expression at once.

## Respecting skin, respecting users

Skin stretches and ages; apps live on shifting devices and networks. In both, you design for change. You pick line weights (or abstractions) that won’t collapse later. The kindness is in the choices no one sees.

## Process and aftercare

Prep, stencil, line, shade, color, wrap, and then the part most people forget: aftercare. Software has an aftercare phase too—maintenance, upgrades, documentation, handoff. Good shops and good teams take both seriously.
